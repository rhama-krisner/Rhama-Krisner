## About me
I've been studying programming for 5 years, and I'm in the 1st year of graduation. I'm a python backend developer.
Programming has always been a passion, a passion for solving problems and creating things. Knowing that I'm able to create whatever I want with just my computer and internet fascinates me absurdly. I don't care about what I'm creating (as long as it's good for people), I like the feeling of creating.
